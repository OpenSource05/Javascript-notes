# Javascript
### Use of comments
* For one line comment - ** `//this is a comment` **
* For multiple ines - ** `/* this is multi line comment */` **

### Datatypes
* the different data types are: 
     * number
     * bigint
     * boolean
     * String
     * null
     * undefined
     * symbol
     * object
 * Variables are declared using `var`, `let`,`const`.
 
 ### Assignment operator
 * `=` is used to assign a value to variable
 * ```js
   let myName = 'Shreyasi';
   ```
 ### Assigning one variable to another
 * ```js
   var a;
   a = 7;
   var b;
   b=a;
   ```
### Unintialized variables
* When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of `undefined`. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be `NaN` which means "Not a Number"

### Case sensitivity of variables
* Javascript variables follow `camel case`
* ` myVar, inMyCity , iDontGiveAFuck;`

### Adding numbers
* `let a = 10+ 20;`

### Subtracting numbers
* ` let a = 20-10;`

### Multiplying numbers
* `let a = 8*8; `

### Dividing numbers
* `let a = 18/2 ;

### Incrementing number
* `i++` i.e `i=i+1`

### Decrementing number
* `i--` i.e `i=i-1`

### Storing decimals
* decimal numbers can also be stored in variabbles
* `let a = 6.8; `
* `let b = 2.0 * 2.5 //5.0`
* `let c = 4.4 / 2.0 //2.2`

### Finding Remainder
* `let a = 5%2 //1`
* `let b = Math.floor(5 / 2) //2 is the quotient

### Compound assignment with augmented addition
* myVar = myVar + 5;
can be written as
` myVar+=5`

### Compound assignment with augmented subtraction
* myVar = myVar - 3;
can be written as
`myVar -= 3`

### Compound assignment with augmented multiplication
* myVar = myVar * 6;
can be written as
` myVar*=6`

### Compound assignment with augmented didvision
* myVar =  myVar / 8;
can be written as 
`myVar/= 8;`

### Declaring string variables
* `let myName = "Shreyasi Patil";`

### Escaping literal quotes in string
* use of " and ' in string - if using same " in two places - 
```js
var string = "Alan said \"Petter is learning javascript"\.";
```

### Quoting Strings with Single Quotes Passed
* `let stringOfMyOwn = 'Jake asks Finn "Hey, let\'s go on a adventure?"'`

### Escape sequences in string
* \'	single quote
*  \"	double quote
*  \\	backslash
*  \n	newline
*  \r	carriage return
*  \t	tab
*  \b	word boundary
*  \f	form feed

### Concatinate strings with Plus Operator
